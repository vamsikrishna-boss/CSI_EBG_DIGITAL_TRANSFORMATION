# Overall Project

## The project is CSI_EBG_DIGITAL_TRASFORMATION

   **CSI** is company name.Coputer service INC

   **EBG** It is Service

   **Digital transformation** is the B2C Business to employee Experience.

  In this Identity Server In this Two things. 

  Identity Server: Identity server is the service and in this give platform login to the digital banking.    

  Identity Provider: Identity provider means like bank like CSI. they will provide Username and password. 
  
  Identity provider will be provide authentication and server it will login. 
  
  Ex: Instagram page is server and the user name and password you are giving it's a provider. That is called identity provider.

  These are 2 users like One is mobile user and second one is the Laptop user.  
   
  Laptop: In this user use the it will ask for username and password after checkin login button. then trying to login wit credentials. then it valid by Open Id. 
  
  Open ID is a protocol and it is valid Security if incase user credetials is valid.
  
  Once give the credentials after login to the application openid checks and used by authentication.

  In this user use the it will ask for username and password once give the credentials after open Id that is protical.that protocol generate one token that is called JWT.
  
  You got some doubt? Y this token is generate? 
  
  iam user you know but Computer don't know so that's why i have access to take some kind of modules in the application.so each user help of the creationg one autherization token.

   What it will do ?
   
   That autherization is nothing but some kind of nformation.
   
   Once login to the customer then authentication and autherization done User and admin login to the application.Like token is produced from Oauth protocol or FDX. 
	 
   After passing the tokenit will redirect and checks who is the Admin who is the user.

   Admin is nothing but employee and user is nothing but Cutomer. 
   
   After login the server will use the Oauth protocol from the Admin. Genaerate the JWT token hit the server.
   
   Oauth is knothing but Some part of the Authentication. 
   
   Server and JWT token some parts of the authentication.

   If the Customer is the USER.
   
   The Cx is bank of america user.
   
   These will be two users. first user will do give the username and password directly go through to the authentication.
   
   Identity server Two types 1. CSI provider   2. Bank provider. 
  
   ## CSI provider: 
   There are bank of america many banks is there.but they want to use OWN authentication. This CSI not only bank OF america this CSI under so many banks ar there.but there are less security.
   Then CSI will ask to Create Identity provider them. then After creating validate username and password is like. these it will identity provider. the Identity server will check these person give the 
   credentials that credentials write or wrong.    
   
   It will send the JWT token to the CX who has loged in. that JWT token goes to the FDX Where all API s are storedd.Fdx TOKEN WILL SEND IT VALIDATION. Like RBAC.
   Then it will check auterized API. then Authentication is completed.

   If the Cx wants to check the loans but he doesn't have permission  becz there is no loans are FDX WILL NOT CHECK.LIKE FAILED.

   user is based on the newtwork. employe will go the identity Server and 	open iD connect then will provide the access to user. this is the Overall project.

   B2c customers : like b2c customer is business to customer like this projects are run into B2c packages. like business means provide the authentication and autherization customer a well.

   FDX: it is the bi directional communication system. in this two end nodes 1 is that SEND 2. Receive. at the same single carrier and dual communication that is called FDX.	
   
   JWT is nothing but JSON Web token.It means some kind of information.
